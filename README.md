This extension adds a button to the top right bar (next to chat & participant list) to enable grid-view in Google Meets. Grid view gives every participant an equal sized video for use in meetings without a primary speaker (such as working from home silent meetings).

This extension forcibly loads every participant's video when grid view is enabled and may cause performance issues in extremely large meetings.

Includes a variety of options to enhance your meeting: include your own video, highlight who is speaking, and hide participants without video!
